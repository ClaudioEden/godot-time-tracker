# Godot Time Tracker
![](icon.png)

This is a time tracking tool that allows you to keep track of projects and tasks logs.

This was made as an experiment to see whether or not Godot is capable of creating non-gaming related applications.

# Godot Engine for Software Development?
I dare say that Godot Engine is a viable option for software development. Having said that, I would not recommend it over other IDEs that were made with software development in mind.

However, If you are comfortable using Godot Engine and would like to create a small app, go ahead and knock yourself out. :)
